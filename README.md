## What 
ETL (extract, transform, load) data from a `MS SQL` database to a `postgres` database. 


## Get started
- Write & parameterize the SQL query of the data to extract. 
- Create a `sql` file with your SQL query, and an identical `job` file that you can then schedule with `cron`


## Misc

- Start `postgres` locally! `$ postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres9.5/ &`
